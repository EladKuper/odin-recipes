        <!--The steps-->
        <h2> Steps: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the sauce, take 1lb of ground beef and 1lb of ground pork and mix together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Then in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, add in enough oil to coat the bottom. Take about half of your meat mixture and pat it into a large thin patty. <br>Sear your meat in the pot for about 2-3 minutes on both sides. Repeat that until you use all of your meat. Remove meat from the pan and set it off to the side.</li>
            <li>In that same pan, cook off 4 ounces of guanciale or pancetta over medium heat until it releases its fat and fried itself in it. Once that’s done frying, add to that pot 1 medium onion <br>finely diced, 1 finely diced celery, and 2 finely diced carrots. Give it a stir and let it saute over medium heat for about 2 minutes or until all the vegetables turn translucent.</li>
            <li>Then add in 3 tablespoons of tomato paste. Stir and let it cook in the pot until it begins to stick to the bottom. Add in 1 cup of white wine or water and give it a stir. <br>Let the mixture simmer until it’s reduced by about half. Then add in 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock, 17.6 ounces of crushed tomatoes, and your cooked meat. <br>Allow that to simmer for about 1-2 hours or until it’s reduced and mostly meaty.</li>
            <li>To make your own pasta, add 3 cups of all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon of fine sea salt into a bowl and whisk together. Make a well in the flour mixture and add in 5 whole eggs. <br>Start whisking together with a fork, slowly bringing in the flour from the sides. Once it starts to come together, begin kneading.</li>
            <li>Once you get a nice cohesive dough, knead until it’s relatively smooth. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for about an hour.</li>
            <li>After your dough has rested, divide into 4 equal parts and flatten each piece into a rough oveal. Run it through a pasta roller at the thickest setting; making sure to dust it with flour. <br>Keep rolling that dough on a thinner and thinner setting one at a time until you reach the final setting.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season it generously with salt. </li>
            <li> 
                <ul>
                    <li>For fresh noodles, blanch them in the water for about 10 seconds and pull them out immediately.</li>
                    <li>If you’re using premade noodles, cook your noodles in the pot until it’s very very al dente.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To assemble your lasagna, first grease a 9x13 inch baking pan with butter. Apply a very thin layer of sauce in the bottom to prevent sticking. Then layer your lasagna by placing a layer <br>of pasta sheets, ½ cup of whole milk ricotta, fresh basil leaves, prosciutto di parma, your meat sauce and then a layer of parmigiano-reggiano, fontina and mozzarella. <br>Repeat this layering process until the pan is full.</li>
            <li>Top your lasagna with cheese and place on a baking sheet. Put your lasagna in the oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and cook for one hour or until nice and brown. <br>Remove from the oven and let it rest for 20-25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
