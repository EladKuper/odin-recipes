        <p>A bowl of this soup will cure all you problems. <br>
            This Cantonese dish is very famous and eaten all around the world, but came to my knoladge only when I was traveling in China.<br>

                 Make sure to stir constantly the whole time.</li>
            <li>Drain out the oil. Store the oil in a sealable container. It will stay good for 2 months in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Remove all the spices, scallions, and ginger slices. save the fried onion and garlic for the filling.</li>
            <li>Roughly diced 200 grams of peeled and deveined shrimp. Add it to a big mixing bowl along with 300 grams of ground chicken thigh.</li>
            <li>Season with 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp of fish sauce, 1 tbsp of oyster sauce, 1 tbsp of chinese cooking wine, and some white pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Stir the protein within 1 direction for 5 minutes to develop the texture. Add the fried aromatics, the diced garlic chives. Keep stirring the filling until everything is well combined.</li>
            <li>Put some filling in the middle of the wonton wrapper. Gather the edge together and pinch to close it. This recipe is enough to make 50-60 pieces of the wonton.</li>
            <li>Bing 8 cups of chicken stock to a boil. Season it with some salt by taste. Add the wonton. Cook over medium low heat until the wonton float to the top of the water<br>
                and the pot should come back to a simmer. Add 1/2 cup of cold water to drop the temperature. Wait for the pot to come back to a simmer again. The total cooking time will take about 8-10 minutes.<br>
