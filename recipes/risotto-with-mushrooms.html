    <!--Description-->
    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>England was such a joy for me but never more so than when I discovered the many forests and woods full of fungi.<br>  
        During autumn I like to go to the woods and forage; they are a haven of peace and where I feel at my best.</p>
    <p>I have passed my passion onto my children and whenever we can at the weekend we will go on mushroom hunts, <br>
        both girls competing with each other as to who can find the first porcini and who can fill their basket the fastest! </p>   
    <p>Sometimes, as a treat, I bring the camping stove and we end the day with a mushroom feast, making a wonderful risotto.  <br>
        If you don’t have wild mushrooms, then use cultivated ones plus dried porcini.</p> 

    <!--Ingredients-->
    <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1  stick celery, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1  small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>375 gr arborio rice</li>
        <li>175 ml dry white wine</li>
        <li>200 gr mixed mushrooms, wild or cultivated, roughly chopped <br>
            (if you are using cultivated add 10 gr dried porcini regenerated in water – keep the water)</li>
        <li>1.5 litres good vegetable stock, kept hot</li>
        <li>50 gr parmesan cheese, freshly grated & extra for sprinkling</li>
        <li>50 gr butter</li>
        <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Steps-->
    <h2> Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a medium heavy-based saucepan.  Add the onion and celery and sweat until softened. </li>
        <li>Stir in the rice with a wooden spoon and coat each grain with the oil. </li>
        <li>Add the wine and allow to evaporate. </li>
        <li>Stir in the mushrooms and regenerated porcini, if using, adding a couple of tablespoons of the water. </li>
        <li>Add a couple of ladles of hot stock and, stirring continuously, cook until the stock is absorbed.  Add more stock and repeat.  <br>
            Continue adding stock in this way and stirring, for about 20 minutes until the rice is cooked – it should be soft on the outside but “al dente” on the inside.   </li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and with a wooden spoon beat in butter and parmesan until the risotto has a creamy consistency. </li>
        <li>Check for seasoning and if necessary, add some salt & pepper. </li>
        <li>Leave to rest for one minute, then serve with an extra sprinkling of grated parmesan if desired. </li>
    </ol>
